### Hi, welcome to my website!

I'm **Kaiwen Li**, a recent Master's graduate in Human-Computer Interaction from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. My research interests lie in human-central computing, including **interactive systems**, **Tangible User Interaction**, **Virtual Reality**, **Mix Reality**, and **Information Visualization**. Beside academics, I am interested in video games and anime.

Currently I am very interested in the topics of innovative interactive design in VR and automatic visualization of info-graphics.
