### Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Kaiwen Li (李恺文). I am currently a research assistant and recently obtained my master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2023. My research focuses on immersive visualization techniques, particularly in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), and their applications in enhancing user engagement with complex data. I have contributed to various projects on tangible interfaces, immersive storytelling, and emotional VR therapy. My work has been presented at prominent conferences such as CHI and ChinaVis.
